# stove_monitor
Code for the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon

This code is designed for the Teensy LC, a DHT11 temperature sensor, and a CC3000 wifi module. It's to help relieve my 
Dad of his paranoia that the stove is off everytime we leave the house.

You need the following library files.
CC3000 for the wifi module
Temboo 
and the dht11 library files
